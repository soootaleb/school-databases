# Database Project

This project aims to explore a dataset

# Project Management

  * The work is done ins this repository
    * Code can be done in whatever language in the `src` folder
    * Documentation must be detailed in the `doc`
    * Datasets must be centralized in the `data`. Please rename data sets to make them comprehensive
  * Each collaborator **must document** his work. It means that every work / research must be described in a *markdown* (`.md`) file.
  * Each work / research must be done in a separate file

As a result, at the end of the project, **the documentation must allow anyone to produce the report**.
